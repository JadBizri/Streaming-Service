INTRODUCTION
------------

Streaming Service is a program that gives users the amount of money they could potentially make from uploading songs oon various streaming platforms. The program starts by giving the user 3 options to choose from. The first option is to upload 1 song and calculate its earnings, the second option is to upload multiple songs at a time, and the third is to exit the program. If they choose not to end the program, it then prompts the user about which streaming platform they wish to upload the song(s) to, as well as the song's name, artist's name and the number of streams each song has. It then calculates the amount of money that would be earned based on the amount of streams and the chosen streaming service. If the user chooses to upload multiple songs at a time, the program also calculates a record label's take on the revenue (either a major label or an independent label).
