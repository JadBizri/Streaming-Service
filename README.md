INTRODUCTION
------------

Computer Hardware is a program that gives users the recommended graphical quality of a computer based on the hardware it has. The program starts by prompting user for number of computers that need to be tested. The program then prompts user about CPU/GPU clockspeeds, number of processor cores, and the display's resolution. It then calculates a performance score and determines the recommended graphical quality (Unable to play, Low, Medium, High, Ultra). The prolgram will loop until all computers have been tested.
